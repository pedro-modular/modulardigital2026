If you’re building a micro‑SaaS—or learning from those who are—**BuildVoyage** is a curated directory that showcases real products, the technology stacks behind them, and the meaningful  
milestones along their journey. Unlike crowded launch lists, **BuildVoyage** focuses on steady progress, clear stack labels, and useful discovery.

What Is **BuildVoyage**?

**BuildVoyage** is a curated micro‑SaaS directory where each approved product gets a clean public page with logo, tagline, links, and a clearly labeled tech stack. Over time, founders add  
milestones and updates, making it easy to learn from real examples and see how products evolve in the wild.

*   Explore **BuildVoyage**: [https://buildvoyage.com/](https://buildvoyage.com/)
*   Submit your product: [https://buildvoyage.com/submit](https://buildvoyage.com/submit)
*   Browse the directory: [https://buildvoyage.com/products](https://buildvoyage.com/products)

Why **BuildVoyage** Exists — A Calm, Human Directory

Most directories over‑optimize for launch‑day hype. **BuildVoyage** takes the opposite approach:

*   Curated, not crowded: Manual review keeps signal high and noise low.
*   Journey‑focused: Products can publish milestones as they grow.
*   Maker‑positive: Lightweight “cheers” instead of competitive leaderboards.
*   Stack‑first discovery: Learn from real stacks in production.

How **BuildVoyage** Works:

*   Submit: Share your product, links, and stack. Submissions are curated for clarity and fit.
*   Publish: Approved products get a public page with logo, tagline, and a stack section.
*   Update: Add milestones over time to show traction, features, and learnings.
*   Discover: Filter by category or tech stack to find similar products and patterns.
